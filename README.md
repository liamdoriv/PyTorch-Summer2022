# PyTorch-Summer2022
All of my PyTorch notes. From basic to advanced.

### Extra Documentations/Notes

Currently, I've been using these references as my main sources for learning PyTorch. I've found that the CS229 Stanford pdf notes is almost all you need to understand the theory behind most of ML/DL concepts. Also, reviewing other people's code on GitHub is a fast and pragmatic way to improve skills, thus I have included some GitHub links as well that's helped me so far.
